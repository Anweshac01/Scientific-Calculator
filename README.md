# Scientific-Calculator
This is a scientific calculator which I have created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and it pretty much performs all he tasks that an actual scientific calculator is meant to perform. It has defined clear and delete funcationalities, performs event handling and also handles errors efficiently.
